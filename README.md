Ever wanted concrete proof of who in the group is the REAL scripture master? Well, look no further than Versle!
Versle is a browser-based daily game based off of the New York Times' "Wordle" which gives users a random scripture
from the Standard Works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and has them guess the scripture
reference in as few guesses as possible. Users are awarded more points for fewer guesses (with bonus points for
guessing the exact verse), and their cumulative points are stored on their account between sessions.

Some key features include:
- Secure login functionality.
- Scrollable menus to choose books of the standard works, books of scripture, chapters, and verses.
- A "friends" system allowing for leaderboards between friends and peers.
- The verse is chosen on a per-day basis, and the same verse is provided to players around the world for the day.
- Potential for growth into a "free-play" mode which doesn't provide points to the user's account, if they wish
  to play more than the once per day (as is in Wordle).
